idx: 1
description: >
  This app displays the current weather and time at your location. Its search
  function also enables you to get the current weather at any location via the
  Google Geolocation API.
  <br><br>
  The UI employs a minimalist, flat design with
  weather icons and color themes that change based on the current weather.

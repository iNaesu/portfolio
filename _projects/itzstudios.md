    Ivan is a budding photographer based in Brisbane. With his expanding
    business, Ivan needed a web solution to showcase his work as well as a means
    for clients to get in touch with him. With minimal text, a muted colour
    palette and full-screen image displays, the website is tailored to put
    Ivan's beautiful work in the spotlight.

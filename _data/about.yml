  I am a Brisbane based software developer currently developing a drug testing
  device at Alcolizer Technology. At Alcolizer, I write embedded systems code in
  <b>C</b> and create automated pipelines for data analysis using
  <b>Python, Bash Scripts and Makefiles</b>.
  <br><br>
  My love for both software and design is what first got me interested in web
  development. I believe that how a system looks as well as its user interface
  are both integral to its usefulness and efficacy.
  <br><br>
  I am looking to join a team that is passionate about creating elegant and
  effective software for the web. If you'd like to work with me, please contact
